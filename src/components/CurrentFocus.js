              With the recent blossoming of the field of Data Science, many
              companies assume that their large amount of untapped data is ready
              to start yielding great insights immediately. Unfortunately, if
              the company is not already performing statistical analysis or
              building predictive models with that data, it probably needs quite
              a bit of work before the company can start deriving more benefits.
              These companies can start optimizing their data usage by starting
              with a small team who has expertise in the full range of the
              software development life cycle while also understanding where
              data science overlaps and differs from traditional enterprise
              software.

              Expanding your IT team into data science and machine learning
              involves more than just adding to your database administrator's
              job description or increasing the workload for your report
              writers. Both of those roles focus on recording and reporting
              business transactions. Data science focuses on statistical
              analysis derived from those transactions to provide business
              insights. You are probably already doing some statistical analysis
              for Key Performance Indicators for your business. However, it is
              likely that you could also benefit from additional statistical
              analysis of internal data, in order to improve operational
              processes. Many companies are now exploring how machine learning
              can use their data to train models that can predict results for
              new examples of data.

              I have worked on web applications, web services, and machine
              learning applications. I can help organize data sources, implement
              data pipelines, and productize machine learning applications to
              provide data-driven improvements for a business:
            </p>
            <ul className="disc">
              <li>Evidence-based improvement.</li>
              <li>Statistical analysis of historical trends.</li>
              <li>
                Build machine learning prototypes to make predictions based on
                historical data.
              </li>
              <li>Productize machine learning prototypes.</li>
              <li>
                Apply enterprise software practices to data science projects.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I can work with your IT team to determine ways in which your
              untapped data can enhance business processes.
